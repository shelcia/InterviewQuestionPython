# Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:

# for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

#     for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
#         // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order
#         if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {
#             swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);
#         }
#     }

# }
# Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

# Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where  is the number of swaps that took place.
# First Element: firstElement, where  is the first element in the sorted array.
# Last Element: lastElement, where  is the last element in the sorted array.
# Hint: To complete this challenge, you must add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

# Example

# swap    a
# 0       [6,4,1]
# 1       [4,6,1]
# 2       [4,1,6]
# 3       [1,4,6]
# The steps of the bubble sort are shown above. It took  swaps to sort the array. Output is:

# Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
# First Element: 1
# Last Element: 6
# Function Description

# Complete the function countSwaps in the editor below.

# countSwaps has the following parameter(s):

# int a[n]: an array of integers to sort
# Prints

# Print the three lines required, then return. No return value is expected.

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer, , the size of the array .
# The second line contains  space-separated integers .

# Constraints

# Output Format

# Sample Input 0

# STDIN   Function
# -----   --------
# 3       a[] size n = 3
# 1 2 3   a = [1, 2, 3]
# Sample Output 0

# Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
# First Element: 1
# Last Element: 3
# Explanation 0
# The array is already sorted, so  swaps take place.

# Sample Input 1

# 3
# 3 2 1
# Sample Output 1

# Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
# First Element: 1
# Last Element: 3
# Explanation 1
# The array is not sorted, and its initial values are: . The following  swaps take place:

# At this point the array is sorted and the three lines of output are printed to stdout.


# Complete the countSwaps function below.
